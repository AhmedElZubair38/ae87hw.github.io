<font face=arial color=red size=+2>I</font> am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.  There are many
things I like to do, to see, and to experience.  I like to read, I like to
write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at
night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the
wind coming from the ocean.

<font face=arial color=violet size=+2>I</font> always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les
Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher".  They have
influenced millions of people through their books.
